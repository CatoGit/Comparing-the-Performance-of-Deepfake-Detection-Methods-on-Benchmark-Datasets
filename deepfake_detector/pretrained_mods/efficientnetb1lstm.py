    """
    Implementation of a EfficientNetB1 + LSTM that was one part of the DeepfakeDetection Challenge
    Rank 90 private leaderboard solution https://www.kaggle.com/c/deepfake-detection-challenge/leaderboard 
    with image size 240x240 and imagenet pretrained weights

    # Architecture inspired by https://www.kaggle.com/unkownhihi/dfdc-lrcn-inference

    To make it comparable with ResNet50 + LSTM it uses the same fully connected layers and 
    also uses 512 hidden units as it was described in the paper
    DeeperForensics-1.0: A Large-Scale Dataset for Real-World Face Forgery Detection (https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.03024)
